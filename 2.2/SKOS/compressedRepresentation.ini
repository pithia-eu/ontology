label: CompressedRepresentation
description:CompressedRepresentation describes formalism of the compressed representation of voluminous or complex 3D, 2D, and 1D data. Typical examples are spherical harmonics for 2D maps on the sphere, truncated Fourier transforms (harmonics) for diurnal time series, Empirical Orthogonal Functions (EOF).
