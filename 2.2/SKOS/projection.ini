label: PITHIA Projection
description:Projection describes (for vector properties) a plane or a line on which the vector projection is observed by the instrument. The Projection is provided in the data ONLY IN THOSE CASES when observation does not specify the vector property in full. Typical projections are horizontal, line of sight, orbital, perpendicular... The Projection has to be accompanied by a suitable description of the coordinate reference system (crs).
