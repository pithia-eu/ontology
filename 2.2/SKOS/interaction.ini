[Reflection]
label:Reflection
altlabel:RI
date: 2014-03-13 10:30:00.0
version: 0.1
definition:Change of the direction of wave propagation at a surface interface into a medium of different refractive index that returns the wave into the medium from which it originated.

[Refraction]
label:Refraction
altlabel:Rr
date: 2014-03-13 10:30:00.0
version: 0.1
definition:Change of the direction of wave propagation as it crosses a surface interface into a medium of different refractive index where the wave speed is different; governed by the Snell's law.

[Scatter]
label:Scatter
altlabel:Sc
date: 2014-03-13 10:30:00.0
version: 0.1
definition:Forced deviation of the wave from a straight trajectory by one or more localized irregularities in the medium through which it passes, usually resulting in multiplicity of the propagation paths in the medium.

altlabel:WPI
date: 2014-03-13 10:30:00.0
version: 0.1
definition:Strong energy exchange between wave and particles of the propagation medium when their phase velocities are close.
