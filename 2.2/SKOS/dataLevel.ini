[L0]
label:Level 0
date:  10:30:00.0
version: 0.1
definition:Raw samples acquired by sensor instrumentation in their entirety and full resolution, presented in the instrument-specific units.

[L1]
label:Level 1
altlabel:z
date: 2022-04-28 10:30:00.0
version: 0.1
definition:Instrument-specific observed properties derived from Level 0 data by a sequence of computational processes to calibrate, clean, reduce volume, enhance quality, or convert the presentation to physical units. Typical example processes for transitioning to Level 1 are: enhancement of signal-to-noise ratio (pulse compression, excision of interference and outliers, look integration, synthetic aperture beamforming), cross-channel equalization (for the multi-channel or multi-element observations), compensation of distortions such as aberration or defocusing, derivation of secondary physical quantities of the probing signal (e.g., angle of arrival from multi-channel reception), spectral analysis of the observed signal, data reduction to retain only important quantities (e.g., resolution reduction or data compression, thresholding to detect principal signal components).

label:Level 2
date: 2022-04-28 10:30:00.0
version: 0.1
definition:Geophysical properties of the primary Feature of Interest derived from Level 0/1 instrument data by a sequence of computation processes. The spatial extent and time resolution of Level 2 data are usually constrained to those of the source instrument data. Transition to Level 2 commonly includes geolocation of the Feature of Interest and may rely on underlying model assumptions about the feature (such as the slant-to-vertical total electron density transformation or tomography computations). Most commonly, it is the Level 2 resource that the instrument teams release to science community at large for reasoning about the Feature of Interest.

[L2A]
label:Level 2A
date: 2022-04-28 10:30:00.0
version: 0.1
definition:Direct output of autonomous L2 computations without human interaction
broader:dataLevel/L2

[L2B]
label:Level 2B
date: 2022-04-28 10:30:00.0
version: 0.1
definition:L2 computations validated by a human-assisted procedure of data quality control
broader:dataLevel/L2

[L3]
label:Level 3
date: 2022-04-28 10:30:00.0
version: 0.1
definition:Same as Level 2, but additionally processed to map observed properties to a uniform spatial and temporal grid. Transition to Level 3 is commonly based on underlying model assumptions about Feature of Interest spatial/temporal extent over areas/times outside the sensor coverage. Typical Level 3 processes are spatial interpolation and extrapolation onto a 2D surface grid and compensation of the short-term measurement latency in real-time weather applications.

[L4]
label:Level 4
date: 2022-04-28 10:30:00.0
version: 0.1
definition:Model computations generated with or without analysis of the lower-level data. May include additional resources external to the data collection (such as characterizations of the geospace activity or additional observations in the multi-instrument experiments).
